# 🧠 Machine Learning Practice Projects – 20 Days 🚀

This repository contains a comprehensive 20-day journey through core concepts, practical tasks, and mini-projects in Machine Learning. It is designed for beginners to intermediate learners who want hands-on experience with real-world datasets and ML models using Python.



## 📌 Project Overview

The content is organized across 20 days of focused learning, where each day tackles a specific ML concept or task. This includes data preprocessing, regression, classification, clustering, model evaluation, and even hands-on mini-projects to apply your understanding in real scenarios.



## 🛠️ Features

- ✅ Structured day-wise ML projects
- 📊 Data analysis and visualization tasks
- 🤖 Algorithms: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, SVM, Naive Bayes, etc.
- 🧪 Model evaluation metrics (accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC)
- 💾 Hands-on datasets and preprocessing
- 📂 Clean and modular codebase for learning
- 🔍 Real-world inspired problem-solving



## 🧰 Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **NumPy**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Seaborn**
- **Scikit-learn**
- **Tkinter** (if any GUI components exist)
- **OpenCV** or **Face Recognition** libraries (if used for Smart Attendance)



Each folder contains well-documented `.ipynb` or `.py` files along with required datasets.



## 🔮 Future Enhancements

- 📦 Integrate with web frameworks (Flask/Django) to deploy ML models
- 📊 Add dashboards for model evaluation
- 🤝 Collaborate with peers to improve accuracy and optimize models
- 📁 Use Git LFS for handling large model or dataset files
- 🧠 Upgrade to deep learning (TensorFlow / PyTorch)
